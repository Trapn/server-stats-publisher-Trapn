Every student is assigned a single stat in the lab.

Publish to the `labict.be` broker and use the topic `linux/stats/<stat>` where `<stat>` is a descriptive name you choose for your stats. Make sure to document it inside this `README.md`

Complete this `README.md` file stating how to setup the scripts and what cron jobs to add. No `README.md` no credits!
